# Heart Disease Prediction

This project uses machine learning algorithms to predict heart disease.

## Data

The data used in this project is the Cleveland Heart Disease dataset, which is available from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The dataset contains 303 observations and 14 features. The features are:

* Age
* Sex
* Chest pain type
* Resting blood pressure
* Cholesterol
* Fasting blood sugar
* Resting electrocardiogram
* Exercise-induced angina
* ST-segment slope
* Number of major vessels
* Thallium stress test result
* Heart disease

## Algorithms

The following algorithms are used to predict heart disease:

* Logistic regression
* K-nearest neighbors
* Support vector machines
* Random forest
* Gradient boosting

## Results

The results of the experiments are shown in the following table:

| Algorithm | Accuracy |
|---|---|
| Logistic regression | 0.85 |
| K-nearest neighbors | 0.89 |
| Support vector machines | 0.875 |
| Random forest | 0.875 |
| Gradient boosting | 0.875 |

The best-performing algorithm is KNN (k-nearest neighbor).

## Conclusion

This project has shown that machine learning algorithms can be used to predict heart disease with a high degree of accuracy. This information can be used to help doctors diagnose and treat heart disease.
